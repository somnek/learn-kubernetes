## `Deployment:
- tool that mages the perfomance and specifies desired behaviour of a `pod`.
- use to communicate what we want from an app. `Kube` then create the desired `state` of the app.

## state:
- ???

## `Cluster`:
- set of `Nodes` run containerized apps. More lightweigh than vm.
## `Node`: 
- name of the machine running kube worker software
## `Container`: 
- lightweight & portable exe image contains software & dependencies
## `Pod`: 
- the thing that run, the one that rebooted, set of running `containers`
- the smallest unit
## `Kubelet`: 
- runs on every node, make sure `containers`s are running in `Pods`
## `Operator`:
- extends the existing `Kube API` (like *HELM*)
